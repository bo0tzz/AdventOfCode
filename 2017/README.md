# Advent of Code 2017

My attempts at the Advent of Code. The extra challenge is that all of the challenges much be done in a completely randomized set of languages. Of course, this repository contains the solutions to the problems! Don't view unless you have already completed the challenges or don't care about spoilers!

## Language Order:

1. Standard ML
2. Clojure
3. Swift
4. Elixir
5. JS
6. Scala
7. D
8. Python3
9. ~~Solidity~~ Java (Solidity does not seem like a suitable language for these challenges)
10. Go
11. Ruby
12. ~~fuck C~~ Java
13. OCaml
14. PHP
15. Haskell
16. Crystal
17. Dart

19. Hack
20. Erlang
21. Lisp

25. Rust

## Experience levels

**0:** Have never heard of this language before.

**2:** Have heard of it, never used it.

**4:** Limited experience with language.

**6:** Worked on small projects, or small discrete pieces of code.

**8:** Worked on medium projects with others.

**10:** Know the language like the back of my hand.
